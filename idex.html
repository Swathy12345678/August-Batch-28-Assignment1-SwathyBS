       <h1>Returing the Self to Nature</h1>
       <p>Returning the Self to Nature is written for the person who no longer wishes to function in a world that revolves around selfish, disconnected identity models and yearns to step into healthy relationships with one’s self, one’s community, and our planet. 
  
        Seeing the suffering of the planet and that of humans as inseparably linked—the ecological crisis as psychological crisis, and vice versa—opens the door to a mutuality of healing between people and nature. At the heart of both chronic and acute forms of narcissism is a socially constructed false self—an isolated, damaged ego in a delusional cycle of selfishness. 
        
        Through unflinching analysis and meditation practices that encourage visualizing and embodying the wild naturalness of being human, the reader will gain skills to begin experiencing a courageous, pluralistic, and ecological self. This book is an invitation to wake up from the dream of the false self and join the movement toward social and planetary healing.
        
        Praise
        “We are in crisis as a world community. On top of political and financial instability, war, and a continued global pandemic, we are also having to contend with the instability of our natural world, the earth, and our climate. In Returning the Self to Nature, Jeanine Canty offers us a path back to nature itself, to start cutting through our individual and collective narcissism to embrace a profound shift to collective concern—which includes care for our planet. This book is such a generous offering, helping us to take compassion action on behalf of our communities and our precious planet.”—Lama Rod Owens, author of Love and Rage: The Path of Liberation through Anger
        
        “Jeanine Canty has brought into focus a problem that affects us both interpersonally and environmentally. The importance of understanding how intertwined racism, sexism, narcissism, and world devastation are is made clear in this wonderful book. The emotional and personal reasons behind why our world is suffering so much are exposed here. What a joy to see the depth of thought, research, and vulnerability that this book offers us, and for all these reasons it is a ‘must read’ in these challenging times.”—Lama Tsultrim Allione, author of Women of Wisdom and Feeding Your Demons</p>
